## Recommended Services

First off, you need a way to pay for the services.

### Electronic Payments

I recommomend all of these options.

#### Prepaid Visa/Mastercard giftcards

Visa and Mastercard offer giftcards that are loadable up to $500 and cost around $5.
They are available in many grocery, gas stations and other stores that sell selections of giftcards.

Things to keep in mind:
- Do not get the reloadable type.
- Read the back to make sure there is no expiration or maintanance fees.
- Some vendors won't accept them.
- Pay with cash and the card is tied to your identity at all (other than security cameras).

You can used them with most vendors.

#### Bitcoin

Bitcoin transactions are public and can be traced to you with much effort.
However, when certain steps are followed, it is much more private than using a standard credit/debit card.

Here is a nice overview about bitcoin privacy: https://bitcoin.org/en/protect-your-privacy

#### Monero

[Monero](https://www.getmonero.org/) is a cryptocurrency designed for privacy.
It is not as widely accepted by vendors as bitcoin though.

#### Virtual Visa/Mastercard

https://privacy.com/virtual-card

Pros:
- use any name, billing address for each card
- very convenient
- create as many virtual cards as you want
- can limit the funds available on a specific card
- can limit a card to a specific merchant
- no fee, because the provider makes money from the transaction fees like regular card providers

Cons:
- cards are funded from your bank so that means the virtual card provider knows your full identity

### Email

[Tutanota](https://tutanota.com/pricing/)

- low price
- end-to-end encryption

I **highly** recommend getting a custom domain name to use for our emails.

### Domain Registrar

https://njal.la/domains/

### Encrypt Network Traffic

#### VPN

https://www.expressvpn.com/order

Supports 5 devices.

#### Tor

Use [Tor](https://www.torproject.org/) when you want an extra level of protection.

### Phone & Mobile Data

#### Mobile Service

https://www.redpocket.com/

Pay by the year: https://www.redpocket.com/plans/annual

Protect this number. Don't give it out lightly. Services can pay for location data of a mobile number.
Give out VOIP numbers instead.

#### VOIP Voice and SMS

https://voip.ms/en/rates/united-states

- supports encryption between their servers and your phone app
- supports SMS and MMS so that you can send/receive texts like a normal mobile number

You need a VOIP client to use the VOIP number.
I recommend [Linphone](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/linphone/id360065638) for a free VOIP client app.
There may be better ones that cost money, but Linphone has worked for me. Here is a link that explains how to configure Linphone with voip.ms: https://wiki.voip.ms/article/Linphone_iOS
